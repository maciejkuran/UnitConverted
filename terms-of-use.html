          <p class="aboutthisproject">
            Maciej Kuran-Janowski provides this website at
            <b>UnitConverted.com</b>
            (referred to hereafter as "the website") for use by Internet uses. By using the website in any way, you are
            agreeing to comply with the Terms of Use. Should you object to any term or condition of the Terms of Use or

          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            UnitConverted.com is a
            <strong>free unit converter tool</strong> that can be used anytime free of charge. As it is a free tool, I
            do not take any responsibility for any possible converting mistakes. This application was built with
            attention to detail and I hope the conversion system for all units works properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            However, <b>do not use</b> this tool for serious and risky ventures. If you do use it, manually check the
            result every time.
          </p>
          <p>The results generated by the unit converter are scientific, i.e. they are not rounded.</p>
